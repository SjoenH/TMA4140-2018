    \section{Chapter 4.4}
    \subsection{Exercise 21}
    Use the construction in the proof of the Chinese remainder theorem to find all solutions to the system of congruences $x \equiv 1(mod 2)$, $x \equiv 2 (mod 3)$, $x \equiv (mod 5)$, and $x \equiv 4 (mod 11)$.
  
    We need to find all solutions to the system of congruences.

    First congruence can be written as:
    \begin{equation}
      \begin{split}
        x \equiv  1(mod2)\\
        x = 2m + 1
      \end{split}
    \end{equation}
    
    Second congruence can be written as:
    \begin{equation}
      \begin{split}
        x \equiv  2(mod3)\\
        x = 3m + 2
      \end{split}
    \end{equation}
    
    Third congruence can be written as:
    \begin{equation}
      \begin{split}
      x \equiv  2(mod5)\\
      x = 3m + 2
      \end{split}
    \end{equation}

    And the final congruence can be written as:
    \begin{equation}
      \begin{split}
        x \equiv 4(mod11)\\
        x = 11m+4
      \end{split}
    \end{equation}

    Using the Chinese theorem, we can find the L.C.D for $2,3,5$ and $11$.
  
    $LCD = 2x3x5x11=330$

    Thus, $x = 330k+I$ where $I$ is $1,2,3,4$ for $mod 2,3,5,11$.

    Then $8,13,18,K,323,K$ are numbers divided by 5 where we get remainder 3.



    $8,13,18,K,323,K$ can be divided by 5 to get remainder 3.
    If the number is $232$ it satisfies all the cases for divisor 2.
    $323 = 2(161)+1$.
    Thus the remainder is 1.
    
    For divisor 3,$323 = 3(107)+2$.
    Thus the remainder is 2.
    
    For divisor 11,
    $323=11(29)+4$.
    Thus the remainder is 4.
    
    And the solution of the provided system of congruences is $x = 232 + 330k$.
    
    \subsection{Exercise 33}
    Use Fermat’s little theorem to find $7^{121} mod 13$.

    \begin{figure}[h]
      \label{theorem:fermat}
      \centering    
      Fermat’s theorem\\
      If $p$ is prime and $a$ is an integer not divisible by $p$, then $ap-1\equiv 1 (mod p)$.\\
      % Furthermore, for every integer a we have $ap \equiv a (mod p)$.
    \end{figure}

By Fermat’s theorem,
$7^{12} \equiv 1(mod13)$
So to find $7^{121}(mod13)$ we have to compute
\begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
    7^{121}&=(7^{12})^{10}\cdot 7(mod13)\\
    &\equiv (7^{12})^{10}(mod13)\cdot 7(mod13)\\
    &\equiv 1(mod13)\cdot7(mod13)\\
    &\equiv 7(mod13)
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
Answer is $7(mod13)$

\subsection{Exercise 37a}
    Show that $2^{340} \equiv 1 (mod 11)$ by Fermat’s little theorem and noting that $2^{340} = (2^{10})^{34}$.

    If $p$ is prime and a is an integer not divisible by p, then
    $a^{p-1}\equiv 1(mod p)$.


    So $2^{10}\equiv 1(mod11)$
    \begin{equation}
      \begin{split}
        2^{340}&=(2^{10})^{34}\\
        &\equiv(2^{10})^{34}(mod11)\\
        &\equiv 1(mod11)
      \end{split}
    \end{equation}

    \section{Chapter 4.5}
    \subsection{Exercise 12}
    Find the sequence of pseudorandom numbers generated by the power generator with $p = 11$, $d=2$, and seed $x_0=3$.


    % The power generator is the method of generating pseudorandom numbers

    Let's use the formulae
    \begin{figure}
      \centering
      \begin{equation}
      \begin{split}
        x_{n+1}=x_n^d mod p\\
        x_{n+1}=x_n^2 mod 1 1
      \end{split}
    \end{equation}
    Where $p=11,d=2, x_0=3$
\end{figure}
  
    So the sequence can be generated as
    \begin{equation}
      \begin{split}
        x_1=3^2mod1 1\\
        \equiv 9 mod 1 1\\
        x_2=9^2mod1 1\\
        \equiv 4 mod 1 1\\
        x_2=4^2mod1 1\\
        \equiv 5 mod 1 1\\
        x_2=5^2mod1 1\\
        \equiv 3 mod 1 1\\
      \end{split}
    \end{equation}
    Then the sequence repeats...
    So the Sequence is $3,9,4,5,3,9,4,5...$

    \section{Chapter 6.1}
    \subsection{Exercise 27}
    A committee is formed consisting of one representative from each of the 50 states in the United States, where the representative from a state is either the governor or one of the two senators from that state. How many ways are there to form this committee?

    The number of different possible committees are $3^{50}=7,178979877e23$

    \subsection{Exercise 44}
    How many ways are there to seat four of a group of ten people around a circular table where two seatings are considered the same when everyone has the same immediate left and immediate right neighbor?

    The number of ways of seating a group of 4 people from the 10 people are
    \begin{equation}
      \begin{split}
        10*9*8*7 =5040
      \end{split}
    \end{equation}

    But our number should be less than this because we don't count all the possible arrangements. We here get 4 of the same seating arrangements that we have remove...
    The required number of ways are therefore
    \begin{equation}
      \begin{split}
        \frac{5040}{4}=1260
      \end{split}
    \end{equation}

    \section{Chapter 6.2}
    \subsection{Exercise 10}
    Let $(x_i,y_i), i = 1,2,3,4,5$,be a set of five distinct points with integer coordinates in the $xy$ plane. Show that the midpoint of the line joining at least one pair of these points has integer coordinates.

    The middle point of two co-ordinates $(x_i,y_i)$ and $(x_j,y_j)$ is $(\frac{x_i+x_j}{2},\frac{y_i+y_j}{2})$. For the co-ordinates mid-point to be an integer,  $(x_i,y_i)$ and $(x_j,y_j)$ needs to be even number and hence should have the same parity.

    Similarly, $y_i$ and $y_j$ have same parit. There are four possible cases of the parity of pair of integers: $(odd,odd),(odd,even),(even,odd),(even,even)$.

    By \textit{pigeon hole principle}, since there are four integer pairs, at least two of them needs to have same parity and hence will have mid-point having integer coordinates.

    \subsection{Exercise 16}
    How many numbers must be selected from the set ${1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15}$ to guarantee that at least one pair of these numbers add up to 16?
    Best case only two: $1+15=16$ but worst case?

    % TODO: SHOW SOLUTION?
    To completely guarantee that at least one pair of the numbers add up to 16, we need to pick at least 5 numbers from the set.

    \subsection{Exercise 18}
    Suppose that there are nine students in a discrete mathematics class at a small college. We can list all possible (Male, Female)-combinations as shown in \fref{fig:groupings}.
   \begin{figure}[h]
    \label{fig:groupings}
    \begin{equation}
      \begin{split}
        (0,9),(1,8),(2,7),(3,6),(4,5),(5,4)(6,3),(7,2),(8,1),(9,0)
      \end{split}
    \end{equation}
    \centering
    In the order (Male, Female)
  \end{figure}
   
    \textbf{a) Show that the class must have at least five male students or at least five female students.}\\
    Considering only two kind of genders, Male and Female. If there are 3 male, then the remaning 6 students must be female and vise versa.

    \textbf{b) Show that the class must have at least three male students or at least seven female students.}\\
    Same as for the exercise above. If 2 male, then the remaning 7 must be female. If more than 2 male, then the statement is still valid.
